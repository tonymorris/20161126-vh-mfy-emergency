  2. YBAF25-2016-2300Z.mp3
  3. YBAF25-2016-2330Z.mp3

  1. ueMeYF2LIUh87r_v.mp4
  2. *slide effect* 'Pilot touches down in emergency landing at Archerfield airport.mp4'

* Not all the following times are exactly accurate. The audio can be easily determined at these intervals though.

* The video requires a title page, displayed for about 15 seconds https://i.imgur.com/jsbebIA.png

* The gaps between the audio times can be fast-forwarded or removed, as long it is clear to the viewer that some time has passed. e.g. use a counter and then just fast-forward, is one way. There might be a better way.
